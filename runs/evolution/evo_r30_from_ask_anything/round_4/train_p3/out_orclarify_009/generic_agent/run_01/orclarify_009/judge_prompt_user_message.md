# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U8, U9, U10, U11, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6
I need help planning the manufacture of toy trucks, toy airplanes, toy boats, and toy trains, where total wood consumption cannot exceed 890 units and total steel consumption cannot exceed 500 units. Additionally, if trucks are manufactured, then trains are not manufactured, and if boats are manufactured, then airplanes are also manufactured.

Profit per toy: truck $5, airplane $10, boat $8, train $7.

Available wood: 890 units.

Wood required per toy: truck 12 units, airplane 20 units, boat 15 units, train 10 units.

Available steel: 500 units.

Steel required per toy: truck 6 units, airplane 3 units, boat 5 units, train 4 units.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning the manufacture of toy trucks, toy airplanes, toy boats, and toy trains.

- U12 (constraint): Number of toy boats manufactured cannot exceed number of toy trains manufactured.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without an objective function, the optimization problem is undefined. A modeling agent cannot proceed to formulate a meaningful model unless the objective is clarified.
- Problem unit ID: U7
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective of the optimization, specifically whether profit should be maximized.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What are we trying to maximize? Should we maximize total profit?
  - Is the goal to maximize profit, or something else like revenue or number of toys produced?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming the objective is to maximize production volume or market share.
  - Assuming the goal is to minimize cost without asking.

## H2: boat_not_exceed_train
- Severity: P2
- Severity reason: The optimization model remains well-defined and solvable without this constraint. The missing rule is a specific business preference that would make the solution more accurate, but its omission does not make the model impossible or fundamentally ill-posed.
- Problem unit ID: U12
- Semantic hit rule: The agent must inquire about a constraint that limits the number of boats relative to the number of trains, specifically asking if boats must be less than or equal to trains.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - Is there any rule linking the number of boats and trains, like boats can't exceed trains?
  - Do we have any production restriction tying the number of boats to the number of trains?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming no relationship between boats and trains and building the model without this constraint.
  - Assuming that boats cannot exceed airplanes instead.

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the production quantities for each toy type required to be whole numbers (integers), or can they be fractional values?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The production quantities for each toy type must be whole numbers (integers).

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the goal to maximize the total profit from the manufactured toys, or is there a different objective such as minimizing resource usage or meeting a specific production target?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The goal is to maximize the total profit from the manufactured toys.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Regarding the rule "if trucks are manufactured, then trains are not manufactured," does this mean that if the number of trucks produced is greater than zero, the number of trains produced must be zero?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

Yes, if the number of trucks produced is greater than zero, the number of trains produced must be zero.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Regarding the rule "if boats are manufactured, then airplanes are also manufactured," does this mean that if the number of boats produced is greater than zero, the number of airplanes produced must also be greater than zero?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

Yes, if the number of boats produced is greater than zero, the number of airplanes produced must also be greater than zero.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

**Confirmed Understanding:**

1.  **Objective:** Maximize total profit.
    *   Profit coefficients: Truck $5, Airplane $10, Boat $8, Train $7.
2.  **Decision Variables:**
    *   $x_T$: Number of trucks produced (integer, $\ge 0$)
    *   $x_A$: Number of airplanes produced (integer, $\ge 0$)
    *   $x_B$: Number of boats produced (integer, $\ge 0$)
    *   $x_R$: Number of trains produced (integer, $\ge 0$)
3.  **Resource Constraints:**
    *   **Wood:** $12x_T + 20x_A + 15x_B + 10x_R \le 890$
    *   **Steel:** $6x_T + 3x_A + 5x_B + 4x_R \le 500$
4.  **Logical Constraints:**
    *   **Truck/Train Exclusivity:** If $x_T > 0$, then $x_R = 0$. (Equivalently, $x_T$ and $x_R$ cannot both be positive).
    *   **Boat/Airplane Dependency:** If $x_B > 0$, then $x_A > 0$. (Equivalently, $x_B$ cannot be positive if $x_A$ is zero).
5.  **Domain:** All decision variables are non-negative integers.
