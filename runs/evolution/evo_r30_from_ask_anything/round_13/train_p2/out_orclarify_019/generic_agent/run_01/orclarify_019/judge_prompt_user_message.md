## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U7, U8, U9, U10, U11, U2, U3, U4, U5
I need help creating a chair ordering plan for manufacturers A, B, and C. The number of orders must be an integer, and total chairs ordered must be at least 100 and at most 500. If the store orders chairs from manufacturer A, then it must order at least 10 chairs from manufacturer B. Additionally, if the store orders chairs from manufacturer B, then it must also order chairs from manufacturer C.

The cost of ordering each chair from manufacturer A is $50, from manufacturer B is $45, and from manufacturer C is $40.

Each order from manufacturer A will include 15 chairs, while each order from manufacturers B and C will include 10 chairs.

Minimum total chairs: 100; maximum total chairs: 500.

When ordering from manufacturer A, the minimum chairs from manufacturer B is 10.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help creating a chair ordering plan for manufacturers A, B, and C.
- U2 (data): The cost of ordering each chair from manufacturer A is $50, from manufacturer B is $45, and from manufacturer C is $40.
- U3 (data): Each order from manufacturer A will include 15 chairs, while each order from manufacturers B and C will include 10 chairs.
- U4 (data): Minimum total chairs: 100; maximum total chairs: 500.
- U5 (data): When ordering from manufacturer A, the minimum chairs from manufacturer B is 10.
- U6 (objective): Minimize the total cost of the order.
- U7 (constraint): The number of orders must be an integer.
- U8 (constraint): Total chairs ordered must be at least 100.
- U9 (constraint): Total chairs ordered must be at most 500.
- U10 (constraint): If the store orders chairs from manufacturer A, then it must order at least 10 chairs from manufacturer B.
- U11 (constraint): If the store orders chairs from manufacturer B, then it must also order chairs from manufacturer C.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without the objective, there is no optimization criterion; a responsible modeling agent cannot proceed because the problem is completely unguided. The agent would be forced to invent a decisive assumption about what to minimize or maximize.
- Problem unit ID: U6
- Semantic hit rule: The Agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective function or what to optimize (minimize/maximize) and cannot simply restate costs without verifying the goal.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What exactly are we trying to optimize? Is the goal to minimize the total cost of the order?
  - Could you clarify the objective – do you want to minimize cost, or is there another target like minimizing the number of orders?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming cost minimization without asking.
  - Assuming a different objective (e.g., minimizing number of orders or maximizing profit).
