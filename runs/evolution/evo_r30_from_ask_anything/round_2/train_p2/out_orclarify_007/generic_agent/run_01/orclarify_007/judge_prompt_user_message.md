- U5 (data): Cost rate: 30 euros per container per kilometer.
- U6 (constraint): Each truck can carry up to 2 containers.
- U7 (objective): Minimize total transportation cost.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: truck_capacity_limit
- Severity: P2
- Severity reason: The truck capacity constraint does not affect the total transportation cost, because cost is per container‑km and the fleet size is not limited. Omitting it still leaves a coherent, solvable optimization problem with the same optimal objective value. It is only a low‑impact operational detail.
- Problem unit ID: U6
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about truck capacity or the maximum number of containers allowed per truck.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - How many containers can each truck carry at most?
  - Is there a limit on the number of containers a truck can transport in one trip?
- Failure modes:
  - Assuming trucks have unlimited capacity
  - Assuming each truck can carry exactly one container

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the total supply of empty containers (124) intended to exactly match the total port demand (114), meaning 10 containers will remain unshipped, or should the model enforce that all 124 containers are transported to the ports (implying the demand figures are minimums rather than exact requirements)?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The demand figures are exact requirements. The total supply of 124 containers exceeds the total port demand of 114, so 10 containers will remain unshipped. The model should satisfy the port demands exactly, not transport all 124 containers.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Should the number of containers shipped from each warehouse to each port be restricted to whole integers, or can the model treat them as continuous values?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The number of containers shipped from each warehouse to each port must be whole integers.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the cost of 30 euros per container per kilometer the only cost component to be minimized, or are there fixed costs (such as per-trip fees or warehouse handling charges) that should also be included in the objective function?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The 30 euros per container per kilometer is the only cost component to be minimized. There are no fixed costs such as per-trip fees or warehouse handling charges to include.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any capacity limits on the number of containers that can be shipped from any specific warehouse to any specific port, or is the only limit on shipments the total inventory available at each warehouse?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

The only limit on shipments is the total inventory available at each warehouse. There are no additional capacity limits on the number of containers that can be shipped from any specific warehouse to any specific port.

READY_TO_MODEL

**Confirmed Understanding:**

1.  **Objective:** Minimize total transportation cost.
2.  **Cost Structure:** The cost is calculated as 30 euros per container per kilometer. This is the only cost component; there are no fixed costs.
3.  **Decision Variables:** Let $x_{ij}$ be the number of containers shipped from warehouse $i$ to port $j$.
    *   **Domain:** $x_{ij}$ must be non-negative integers ($x_{ij} \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$).
4.  **Supply Constraints (Warehouses):**
    *   The total number of containers shipped from each warehouse cannot exceed its available inventory.
    *   Verona: $\sum_j x_{V,j} \le 10$
    *   Perugia: $\sum_j x_{P,j} \le 12$
    *   Rome: $\sum_j x_{R,j} \le 20$
    *   Pescara: $\sum_j x_{Pe,j} \le 24$
    *   Taranto: $\sum_j x_{T,j} \le 18$
    *   Lamezia: $\sum_j x_{L,j} \le 40$
    *   *Note:* Since total supply (124) exceeds total demand (114), these are inequality constraints ($\le$), allowing for 10 containers to remain unshipped.
5.  **Demand Constraints (Ports):**
    *   The total number of containers received by each port must exactly match its demand.
    *   Genoa: $\sum_i x_{i,G} = 20$
    *   Venice: $\sum_i x_{i,Ve} = 15$
    *   Ancona: $\sum_i x_{i,A} = 25$
    *   Naples: $\sum_i x_{i,N} = 33$
    *   Bari: $\sum_i x_{i,B} = 21$
6.  **Parameters:**
    *   Distance matrix ($d_{ij}$) is provided in kilometers.
    *   Cost coefficient for route $(i,j)$ is $30 \times d_{ij}$ euros per container.
7.  **Assumptions:**
    *   None. All formulation-critical facts were explicitly confirmed by the user.
