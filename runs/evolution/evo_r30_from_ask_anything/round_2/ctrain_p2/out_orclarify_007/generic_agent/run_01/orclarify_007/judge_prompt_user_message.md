| Lamezia | $1072 \mathrm{~km}$ | $1097 \mathrm{~km}$ | $747 \mathrm{~km}$ | $372 \mathrm{~km}$ | $333 \mathrm{~km}$ |
- U5 (data): Cost rate: 30 euros per container per kilometer.
- U6 (constraint): Each truck can carry up to 2 containers.
- U7 (objective): Minimize total transportation cost.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: truck_capacity_limit
- Severity: P2
- Severity reason: The truck capacity constraint does not affect the total transportation cost, because cost is per container‑km and the fleet size is not limited. Omitting it still leaves a coherent, solvable optimization problem with the same optimal objective value. It is only a low‑impact operational detail.
- Problem unit ID: U6
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about truck capacity or the maximum number of containers allowed per truck.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - How many containers can each truck carry at most?
  - Is there a limit on the number of containers a truck can transport in one trip?
- Failure modes:
  - Assuming trucks have unlimited capacity
  - Assuming each truck can carry exactly one container

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the total empty container inventory (124) intended to exactly match the total port demand (114), meaning 10 containers will remain unshipped, or should the model require that all 124 containers be transported to the ports (implying the demand figures are minimums rather than exact targets)?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The demand figures are exact targets. The total port demand is 114 containers, so only 114 containers will be transported. The remaining 10 containers from the warehouse inventory will stay at the warehouses and are not part of the transportation plan.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the warehouse inventory figures (e.g., Verona 10, Perugia 12) hard upper limits on how many containers can be shipped from each warehouse, or are they just descriptive data where the model is free to ship any amount up to that number?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The warehouse inventory figures are hard upper limits. You cannot ship more containers from a warehouse than it currently holds.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the cost of 30 euros per container per kilometer the only cost component to minimize, or are there fixed costs (such as a flat fee per truck or per warehouse activation) that should also be included in the objective function?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The 30 euros per container per kilometer is the only cost component to minimize. There are no fixed costs per truck or per warehouse activation.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the container flows between warehouses and ports required to be whole numbers (integers), or can the model treat them as continuous values (e.g., shipping 1.5 containers)?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

The container flows must be whole numbers. You cannot ship a fraction of a container.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

**Confirmed Understanding:**

1.  **Objective:** Minimize total transportation cost.
2.  **Cost Structure:** The only cost is variable, calculated as 30 euros per container per kilometer. There are no fixed costs.
3.  **Decision Variables:** Let $x_{ij}$ be the number of containers shipped from warehouse $i$ to port $j$.
    *   **Domain:** $x_{ij}$ must be non-negative integers ($x_{ij} \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$).
4.  **Supply Constraints (Warehouses):**
    *   The total containers shipped from each warehouse cannot exceed its inventory.
    *   Verona: $\sum_j x_{V,j} \le 10$
    *   Perugia: $\sum_j x_{P,j} \le 12$
    *   Rome: $\sum_j x_{R,j} \le 20$
    *   Pescara: $\sum_j x_{Pe,j} \le 24$
    *   Taranto: $\sum_j x_{T,j} \le 18$
    *   Lamezia: $\sum_j x_{L,j} \le 40$
    *   *Note:* Since total demand (114) is less than total supply (124), these are inequalities (upper bounds), not equalities.
5.  **Demand Constraints (Ports):**
    *   The total containers received at each port must exactly equal its demand.
    *   Genoa: $\sum_i x_{i,G} = 20$
    *   Venice: $\sum_i x_{i,Ve} = 15$
    *   Ancona: $\sum_i x_{i,A} = 25$
    *   Naples: $\sum_i x_{i,N} = 33$
    *   Bari: $\sum_i x_{i,B} = 21$
6.  **Parameters:**
    *   Distance matrix $d_{ij}$ (km) is provided.
    *   Cost coefficient $c_{ij} = 30 \times d_{ij}$ (euros per container).

**Assumptions:**
*   None. All formulation-critical facts were confirmed by the user.
