## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U5, U6, U2, U3
I need help planning the staffing for a 24-hour convenience store, and for each time period, the number of salespeople scheduled to work during that period must be at least the required number for that period, while each salesperson works exactly one 8-hour shift, starting at one of the specified start times (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, or 22:00), covering the four consecutive 2-hour periods from the start time.

Required number of salespeople per time period:
2:00-6:00: 10
6:00-10:00: 15
10:00-14:00: 25
14:00-18:00: 20
18:00-22:00: 18
22:00-2:00: 12

Shift start times: 2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00. Shift duration: 8 hours.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning the staffing for a 24-hour convenience store.
- U2 (data): Required number of salespeople per time period:
2:00-6:00: 10
6:00-10:00: 15
10:00-14:00: 25
14:00-18:00: 20
18:00-22:00: 18
22:00-2:00: 12
- U3 (data): Shift start times: 2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00. Shift duration: 8 hours.
- U4 (objective): Minimize the total number of salespeople needed to meet the requirements.
- U5 (constraint): For each time period, the number of salespeople scheduled to work during that period must be at least the required number for that period.
- U6 (constraint): Each salesperson works exactly one 8-hour shift, starting at one of the specified start times (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, or 22:00), covering the four consecutive 2-hour periods from the start time.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_minimization_objective
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without the objective function, the agent cannot determine what constitutes an optimal solution; the problem is ill-posed and modeling cannot proceed meaningfuly.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective or goal of the staffing problem, specifically whether the aim is to minimize the total number of salespeople.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What are we trying to optimize here? Is the goal to minimize the total number of salespeople?
  - Just to confirm, are we minimizing the total headcount of salespeople scheduled overall?
- Failure modes:
  - Silent incorrect assumption: Assuming the objective is to minimize total labor cost rather than total number of salespeople.
  - Silent incorrect assumption: Assuming the objective is to maximize service level or employee satisfaction without clarification.
  - Silent incorrect assumption: Proceeding to build a feasible schedule without any optimization objective.

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the goal to minimize the total number of salespeople scheduled across all six shifts, or is there a different objective such as minimizing total labor cost with different pay rates per shift?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The goal is to minimize the total number of salespeople scheduled across all six shifts. There are no different pay rates per shift; we are simply looking for the smallest total headcount that meets the coverage requirements.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the numbers of salespeople assigned to each of the six shift start times required to be whole numbers (integers), or can they be fractional values in the model?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The numbers of salespeople assigned to each shift start time must be whole numbers (integers).

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the salespeople counts for each shift start time required to be non-negative (zero or more), or is there a minimum number of salespeople that must be scheduled for every shift?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The salespeople counts for each shift start time are required to be non-negative (zero or more). There is no minimum number of salespeople that must be scheduled for every shift.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any additional requirements or constraints beyond the coverage minimums and the shift structure, such as a maximum total number of salespeople, a limit on the number of shifts a single person can work, or any other rules I should include in the model?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

No, there are no additional requirements or constraints beyond the coverage minimums and the shift structure.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- Objective: Minimize the total number of salespeople scheduled across all six shifts (sum of the six shift variables).
- Decision variables: Six non-negative integer variables, one for each shift start time (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00), representing the number of salespeople starting their 8-hour shift at that time.
- Variable domain: Each variable is a non-negative integer (≥ 0).
- Shift coverage: A salesperson starting at a given time covers the four consecutive 2-hour periods beginning at that start time.
- Constraints: For each of the six 2-hour periods, the sum of the shift variables whose coverage includes that period must be at least the required number for that period:
  - 2:00–6:00: ≥ 10
  - 6:00–10:00: ≥ 15
  - 10:00–14:00: ≥ 25
  - 14:00–18:00: ≥ 20
  - 18:00–22:00: ≥ 18
  - 22:00–2:00: ≥ 12
- No other constraints: No maximum total headcount, no per-person shift limits, no exclusivity or selection rules, no carry-over or accumulation, no fixed costs, no additional requirements.

Open assumptions: None. All formulation-critical facts are confirmed.
