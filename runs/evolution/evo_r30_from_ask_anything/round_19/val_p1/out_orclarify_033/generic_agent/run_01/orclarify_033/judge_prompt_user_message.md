# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U4, U2
A wealthy noble passed away, leaving an inheritance to be shared between two sons, and I need help dividing the items, but the two Jack Russell racing dogs must not be separated—they must both be assigned to the same son.

- A painting by Caillebotte: $25000
- A bust of Diocletian: $5000
- A Yuan dynasty Chinese vase: $20000
- A 911 Porsche: $40000
- Three diamonds: each $12000
- A Louis XV sofa: $3000
- Two very precious Jack Russell racing dogs: each $3000 (will stipulates they must not be separated)
- A sculpture from 200 AD: $10000
- A sailing boat: $15000
- A Harley Davidson motorcycle: $10000
- A piece of furniture once belonging to Cavour: $13000

## Problem units
- U1 (context): A wealthy noble passed away, leaving an inheritance to be shared between two sons. I need help dividing the items.
- U2 (data): - A painting by Caillebotte: $25000
- A bust of Diocletian: $5000
- A Yuan dynasty Chinese vase: $20000
- A 911 Porsche: $40000
- Three diamonds: each $12000
- A Louis XV sofa: $3000
- Two very precious Jack Russell racing dogs: each $3000 (will stipulates they must not be separated)
- A sculpture from 200 AD: $10000
- A sailing boat: $15000
- A Harley Davidson motorcycle: $10000
- A piece of furniture once belonging to Cavour: $13000
- U3 (objective): Minimize the difference in value between the two parts.
- U4 (constraint): The two Jack Russell racing dogs must not be separated; they must both be assigned to the same son.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective_minimize_value_difference
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without a stated objective, the problem lacks a goal, making it impossible to formulate a meaningful optimization model. The agent must clarify what the division is supposed to achieve (minimize value difference, maximize fairness, etc.).
- Problem unit ID: U3
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective or goal, such as whether we are minimizing the difference in total value, achieving equal sums, or some other fairness criterion.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the goal for dividing the inheritance? Are we trying to give both sons shares of as equal total value as possible?
  - Should we minimize the absolute difference between the total values of the two parts?
- Failure modes:
  - Assuming the goal is merely to assign items without any quantitative objective
  - Assuming the objective is to maximize one son's total value
  - Assuming a simple equal split of the number of items rather than value
  - Assuming the sum of values must be equal without explicitly modeling difference minimization

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the goal to divide the items so that the total value received by each son is as equal as possible, or is there a different objective such as maximizing the value for one specific son?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The goal is to divide the items so that the total value received by each son is as equal as possible. We want to minimize the difference in value between the two shares.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the three diamonds treated as three separate items that can be split between the two sons, or must all three diamonds be assigned to the same son?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The three diamonds are treated as three separate items that can be split between the two sons.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the two Jack Russell racing dogs treated as two separate items that must both be assigned to the same son, or are they considered a single indivisible unit for the purpose of the division?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The two Jack Russell racing dogs are treated as two separate items that must both be assigned to the same son.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any other constraints or requirements for the division, such as a minimum number of items each son must receive, specific items that must go to a particular son, or restrictions on which items can be grouped together?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

No, there are no other constraints or requirements. The only restriction is that the two Jack Russell racing dogs must both be assigned to the same son.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

**Confirmed Understanding:**

1.  **Objective:** Minimize the absolute difference in total value between the two sons' shares.
2.  **Items and Values:**
    *   Painting by Caillebotte: $25,000
    *   Bust of Diocletian: $5,000
    *   Yuan dynasty Chinese vase: $20,000
    *   911 Porsche: $40,000
    *   Three Diamonds: $12,000 each (treated as 3 separate items)
    *   Louis XV sofa: $3,000
    *   Two Jack Russell racing dogs: $3,000 each (treated as 2 separate items)
    *   Sculpture from 200 AD: $10,000
    *   Sailing boat: $15,000
    *   Harley Davidson motorcycle: $10,000
    *   Piece of furniture once belonging to Cavour: $13,000
3.  **Decision Variables:** Binary assignment of each individual item to either Son 1 or Son 2.
4.  **Constraints:**
    *   Each item must be assigned to exactly one son.
    *   The two Jack Russell racing dogs must be assigned to the same son (i.e., if Dog A goes to Son 1, Dog B must also go to Son 1; if Dog A goes to Son 2, Dog B must also go to Son 2).
5.  **Assumptions:**
    *   All items are indivisible (cannot be split).
    *   The total value of the estate is the sum of the listed values.
    *   No other hidden constraints or preferences exist.
