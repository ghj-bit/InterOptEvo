# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U5, U6, U7, U2, U3
I need help planning how many trucks to dispatch daily from two warehouses to a production base, with the requirement that at least 240 pieces of raw material A, 80 kg of raw material B, and 120 tons of raw material C must be brought in daily.

Minimum daily raw material requirements: at least 240 pieces of raw material A, at least 80 kg of raw material B, at least 120 tons of raw material C.

Each truck from warehouse A can transport back to the production base 4 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 6 tons of raw material C, with a freight cost of 200 yuan per truck; each truck from warehouse B can transport back to the production base 7 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 2 tons of raw material C per day, with a freight cost of 160 yuan per truck.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning how many trucks to dispatch daily from two warehouses to a production base.
- U2 (data): Minimum daily raw material requirements: at least 240 pieces of raw material A, at least 80 kg of raw material B, at least 120 tons of raw material C.
- U3 (data): Each truck from warehouse A can transport back to the production base 4 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 6 tons of raw material C, with a freight cost of 200 yuan per truck; each truck from warehouse B can transport back to the production base 7 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 2 tons of raw material C per day, with a freight cost of 160 yuan per truck.
- U4 (objective): Minimize total freight cost.
- U5 (constraint): At least 240 pieces of raw material A must be brought in daily.
- U6 (constraint): At least 80 kg of raw material B must be brought in daily.
- U7 (constraint): At least 120 tons of raw material C must be brought in daily.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective_function
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without an objective, the optimization problem is ill-posed; the modeling agent cannot formulate a meaningful model without knowing what to minimize or maximize.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective or what to optimize, specifically mentioning minimizing or maximizing something, or inquiring about the goal.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the objective we are trying to achieve? Should we minimize total cost?
  - Are we aiming to minimize the total freight cost?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming the objective is to minimize total freight cost without confirming with the user.
  - Assuming the objective is to maximize some other metric like profit or minimize number of trucks.

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the numbers of trucks dispatched from warehouse A and warehouse B required to be whole numbers (integers), or can they be treated as continuous values in the plan?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

They must be whole numbers. You cannot dispatch a fraction of a truck, so the plan needs to use integer values for the number of trucks from each warehouse.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the goal to minimize the total daily freight cost, or is there another objective such as maximizing the total amount of raw material delivered?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The goal is to minimize the total daily freight cost.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any upper limits on the number of trucks that can be dispatched daily from warehouse A or warehouse B, or are the only constraints the minimum raw material requirements?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The only constraints are the minimum raw material requirements. There are no upper limits on the number of trucks that can be dispatched daily from warehouse A or warehouse B.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

1. Decision variables:
   - Let x = number of trucks dispatched daily from warehouse A.
   - Let y = number of trucks dispatched daily from warehouse B.
   - Both x and y must be non-negative integers (confirmed).

2. Objective:
   - Minimize total daily freight cost: 200x + 160y (confirmed).

3. Constraints (all are minimum requirements, i.e., lower bounds):
   - Raw material A: 4x + 7y >= 240 pieces (confirmed).
   - Raw material B: 2x + 2y >= 80 kg (confirmed).
   - Raw material C: 6x + 2y >= 120 tons (confirmed).

4. No upper bounds on x or y (confirmed).

5. No other constraints or exclusivity rules apply (confirmed).

All formulation-critical facts have been confirmed with the client. No open assumptions remain.
