Visible unit IDs: U1, U5, U6, U7, U2, U3
I need help planning a daily feed selection for an animal that meets its nutritional requirements, where total protein from the selected feeds must be at least 700 g, total minerals must be at least 30 g, and total vitamins must be at least 100 mg.

Daily nutritional requirements: at least 700 g of protein, 30 g of minerals, and 100 mg of vitamins.

Nutritional content and price per gram of each feed (Table 1-6):
| Feed | Protein (g) | Minerals (g) | Vitamins (mg) | Price (¥/kg) | Feed | Protein (g) | Minerals (g) | Vitamins (mg) | Price (¥/kg) |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1    | 3           | 1            | 0.5           | 0.2          | 4    | 6           | 2            | 2             | 0.3          |
| 2    | 2           | 0.5          | 1             | 0.7          | 5    | 18          | 0.5          | 0.8           | 0.8          |

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning a daily feed selection for an animal that meets its nutritional requirements.
- U2 (data): Daily nutritional requirements: at least 700 g of protein, 30 g of minerals, and 100 mg of vitamins.
- U3 (data): Nutritional content and price per gram of each feed (Table 1-6):
| Feed | Protein (g) | Minerals (g) | Vitamins (mg) | Price (¥/kg) | Feed | Protein (g) | Minerals (g) | Vitamins (mg) | Price (¥/kg) |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1    | 3           | 1            | 0.5           | 0.2          | 4    | 6           | 2            | 2             | 0.3          |
| 2    | 2           | 0.5          | 1             | 0.7          | 5    | 18          | 0.5          | 0.8           | 0.8          |
| 3    | 1           | 0.2          | 0.2           | 0.4          |      |             |              |               |              |
- U4 (objective): Minimize total cost of selecting the feed.
- U5 (constraint): Total protein from the selected feeds must be at least 700 g.
- U6 (constraint): Total minerals from the selected feeds must be at least 30 g.
- U7 (constraint): Total vitamins from the selected feeds must be at least 100 mg.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective_function
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without knowing the objective, the modeling agent cannot define the optimization direction. The problem does not specify whether to minimize cost, maximize nutritional content, or something else. A responsible agent must clarify this before formulating the model.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the optimization objective, such as what we are trying to minimize or maximize, or specifically mention whether cost is being minimized.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the goal of the feeding plan? Are we minimizing cost or something else?
  - Should we minimize the total cost of the selected feeds?
- Failure modes:
  - Silent incorrect assumption that the objective is to minimize total cost.
  - Silent incorrect assumption that the objective is to minimize total feed weight.


# Full Transcript

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: What is the total daily feed budget in ¥ that the selected feeds must not exceed?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

There is no fixed daily feed budget. The goal is to minimize the total cost of the selected feeds, not to stay within a specific budget cap.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is there a maximum total weight of feed (in grams or kilograms) that the animal can consume in a day?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

There is no maximum total weight of feed specified. The only constraints are the minimum nutritional requirements for protein, minerals, and vitamins.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any upper limits on the amount of any specific feed that can be used in the daily mix?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

There are no upper limits on the amount of any specific feed that can be used in the daily mix.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Can the amounts of each feed be any non-negative real number (continuous), or must they be restricted to whole units like kilograms?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

The amounts of each feed can be any non-negative real number.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- Objective: Minimize the total daily cost (in ¥) of the feed mix.
- Decision variables: The daily amount (in kg) of each of the 5 feeds, where each amount is a non-negative real number.
- Nutritional constraints (minimums):
  - Total protein ≥ 700 g
  - Total minerals ≥ 30 g
  - Total vitamins ≥ 100 mg
- Feed data (per kg of feed):
  - Feed 1: 3 g protein, 1 g minerals, 0.5 mg vitamins, ¥0.2/kg
  - Feed 2: 2 g protein, 0.5 g minerals, 1 mg vitamins, ¥0.7/kg
  - Feed 3: 1 g protein, 0.2 g minerals, 0.2 mg vitamins, ¥0.4/kg
  - Feed 4: 6 g protein, 2 g minerals, 2 mg vitamins, ¥0.3/kg
  - Feed 5: 18 g protein, 0.5 g minerals, 0.8 mg vitamins, ¥0.8/kg
- No budget cap, no maximum total feed weight, and no upper limits on individual feed amounts.
