- U5 (data): Cost rate: 30 euros per container per kilometer.
- U6 (constraint): Each truck can carry up to 2 containers.
- U7 (objective): Minimize total transportation cost.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: truck_capacity_limit
- Severity: P2
- Severity reason: The truck capacity constraint does not affect the total transportation cost, because cost is per container‑km and the fleet size is not limited. Omitting it still leaves a coherent, solvable optimization problem with the same optimal objective value. It is only a low‑impact operational detail.
- Problem unit ID: U6
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about truck capacity or the maximum number of containers allowed per truck.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - How many containers can each truck carry at most?
  - Is there a limit on the number of containers a truck can transport in one trip?
- Failure modes:
  - Assuming trucks have unlimited capacity
  - Assuming each truck can carry exactly one container

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the total empty container supply (124) intended to exactly match the total port demand (114), meaning 10 containers will remain unshipped, or should the model require that all 124 containers be transported to the ports?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The 10 extra containers will remain unshipped. The model should satisfy the port demands (114 total) using the available supply, not force all 124 containers to be transported.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the transportation cost calculated as 30 euros multiplied by the number of containers shipped on a specific route multiplied by the distance of that route, or is there a fixed cost component per shipment or per vehicle that should also be included

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The cost is 30 euros multiplied by the number of containers shipped on a route multiplied by the distance of that route. There is no fixed cost per shipment or per vehicle.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the container quantities on each route required to be whole numbers, or can the model treat them as continuous

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The container quantities on each route must be whole numbers.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any additional constraints, such as maximum capacity limits on specific routes, minimum shipment requirements, or restrictions on which warehouses can ship to

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

No. There are no additional constraints beyond the warehouse inventory limits, the port demand requirements, and the truck capacity of up to 2 containers per trip.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Does the truck capacity limit of 2 containers per trip affect the cost calculation, or is the cost still simply 30 euros per container per

## Turn 5 - User Simulator

The cost is still simply 30 euros per container per kilometer. The truck capacity limit of 2 containers per trip does not change the cost calculation.

READY_TO_MODEL

**Confirmed Understanding:**

1.  **Objective:** Minimize total transportation cost.
2.  **Cost Function:** Total Cost = $\sum_{i,j} (30 \times x_{ij} \times d_{ij})$, where $x_{ij}$ is the number of containers shipped from warehouse $i$ to port $j$, and $d_{ij}$ is the distance in km.
3.  **Decision Variables:** $x_{ij}$ represents the number of containers shipped from warehouse $i$ to port $j$.
4.  **Variable Domain:** $x_{ij}$ must be non-negative integers ($x_{ij} \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$).
5.  **Supply Constraints:** For each warehouse $i$, the total containers shipped out cannot exceed the available inventory:
    *   Verona: $\sum_j x_{V,j} \le 10$
    *   Perugia: $\sum_j x_{P,j} \le 12$
    *   Rome: $\sum_j x_{R,j} \le 20$
    *   Pescara: $\sum_j x_{Pe,j} \le 24$
    *   Taranto: $\sum_j x_{T,j} \le 18$
    *   Lamezia: $\sum_j x_{L,j} \le 40$
6.  **Demand Constraints:** For each port $j$, the total containers received must exactly meet the demand:
    *   Genoa: $\sum_i x_{i,G} = 20$
    *   Venice: $\sum_i x_{i,Ve} = 15$
    *   Ancona: $\sum_i x_{i,A} = 25$
    *   Naples: $\sum_i x_{i,N} = 33$
    *   Bari: $\sum_i x_{i,B} = 21$
7.  **Truck Capacity:** The limit of 2 containers per trip is noted but does not affect the cost calculation or the model formulation, as cost is linear per container-km.
8.  **Data:** Distances are provided in the matrix. Total supply (124) exceeds total demand (114), so 10 containers will remain unshipped.
