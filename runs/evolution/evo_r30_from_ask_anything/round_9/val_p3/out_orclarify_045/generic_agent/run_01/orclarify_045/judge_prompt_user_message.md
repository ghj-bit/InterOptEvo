I need help creating a production plan for a factory producing three types of products, where total technical preparation time used must not exceed 100 hours, total labor time used must not exceed 700 hours, and total materials used must not exceed 400 kg.

Each unit of product A requires 1 hour for technical preparation, 10 hours of direct labor, and 3 kg of materials. Each unit of product B requires 2 hours for technical preparation, 4 hours of labor, and 2 kg of materials. Each unit of product C requires 1 hour for technical preparation, 5 hours of labor, and 1 kg of materials. The available technical preparation time is 100 hours, labor time is 700 hours, and materials are 400 kg.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help creating a production plan for a factory producing three types of products.
- U2 (data): Each unit of product A requires 1 hour for technical preparation, 10 hours of direct labor, and 3 kg of materials. Each unit of product B requires 2 hours for technical preparation, 4 hours of labor, and 2 kg of materials. Each unit of product C requires 1 hour for technical preparation, 5 hours of labor, and 1 kg of materials. The available technical preparation time is 100 hours, labor time is 700 hours, and materials are 400 kg.
- U3 (data): Table 1-22

- U4 (objective): Maximize profit.
- U5 (constraint): Total technical preparation time used must not exceed 100 hours.
- U6 (constraint): Total labor time used must not exceed 700 hours.
- U7 (constraint): Total materials used must not exceed 400 kg.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without knowing the objective, the modeling agent cannot formulate any optimization model. Any assumed objective (e.g., minimize cost) would be completely arbitrary and almost certainly wrong. This is a must-clarify fatal gap.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask what the objective of the optimization is, or directly inquire whether to maximize profit (as opposed to any other default objective).
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the objective of the production plan? Should we aim to maximize profit?
  - Are we trying to maximize total profit, or is there another target like minimizing costs or maximizing revenue?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming the objective is to minimize total cost
  - Assuming the objective is to maximize total revenue
  - Assuming a multi-objective or unspecified goal without clarification

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the goal to maximize total profit, and should the production quantities for each product be restricted to whole numbers (integers) or can they be fractional?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

Yes, the goal is to maximize total profit.

The production quantities for each product must be whole numbers (integers).

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: For the profit tiers in Table 1-22, does the profit rate apply to all units produced within that range (e.g., if 50 units of Product A are produced, all 50 earn 9 yuan each), or does it apply only to the units within that specific tier (e.g., the first 40 earn 10 yuan and the next 10 earn 9 yuan)?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The profit rate applies only to the units within that specific tier. For example, if 50 units of Product A are produced, the first 40 earn 10 yuan each, and the next 10 earn 9 yuan each.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any other constraints or requirements, such as minimum production levels for any product, that must be met in addition to the resource limits and profit maximization goal?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

No, there are no other constraints or requirements. The only constraints are the resource limits for technical preparation time, labor time, and materials.
