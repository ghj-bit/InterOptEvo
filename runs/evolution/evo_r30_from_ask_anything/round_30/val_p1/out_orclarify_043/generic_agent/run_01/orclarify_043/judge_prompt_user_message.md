Visible unit IDs: U1, U5, U6, U7, U2, U3
I need help planning how many trucks to dispatch daily from two warehouses to a production base, with the requirement that at least 240 pieces of raw material A, 80 kg of raw material B, and 120 tons of raw material C must be brought in daily.

Minimum daily raw material requirements: at least 240 pieces of raw material A, at least 80 kg of raw material B, at least 120 tons of raw material C.

Each truck from warehouse A can transport back to the production base 4 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 6 tons of raw material C, with a freight cost of 200 yuan per truck; each truck from warehouse B can transport back to the production base 7 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 2 tons of raw material C per day, with a freight cost of 160 yuan per truck.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning how many trucks to dispatch daily from two warehouses to a production base.
- U2 (data): Minimum daily raw material requirements: at least 240 pieces of raw material A, at least 80 kg of raw material B, at least 120 tons of raw material C.
- U3 (data): Each truck from warehouse A can transport back to the production base 4 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 6 tons of raw material C, with a freight cost of 200 yuan per truck; each truck from warehouse B can transport back to the production base 7 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 2 tons of raw material C per day, with a freight cost of 160 yuan per truck.
- U4 (objective): Minimize total freight cost.
- U5 (constraint): At least 240 pieces of raw material A must be brought in daily.
- U6 (constraint): At least 80 kg of raw material B must be brought in daily.
- U7 (constraint): At least 120 tons of raw material C must be brought in daily.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective_function
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without an objective, the optimization problem is ill-posed; the modeling agent cannot formulate a meaningful model without knowing what to minimize or maximize.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective or what to optimize, specifically mentioning minimizing or maximizing something, or inquiring about the goal.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the objective we are trying to achieve? Should we minimize total cost?
  - Are we aiming to minimize the total freight cost?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming the objective is to minimize total freight cost without confirming with the user.
  - Assuming the objective is to maximize some other metric like profit or minimize number of trucks.

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the numbers of trucks dispatched from warehouse A and warehouse B required to be whole numbers (integers), or can they be treated as continuous values in the model?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

They must be whole numbers. You cannot dispatch a fraction of a truck, so the number of trucks from each warehouse has to be an integer.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the objective to minimize the total daily freight cost, or is there another goal such as maximizing the total amount of raw materials delivered?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The objective is to minimize the total daily freight cost.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any upper limits on the number of trucks that can be dispatched daily from warehouse A or warehouse B, or are the only constraints the minimum raw material requirements?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The only constraints are the minimum raw material requirements. There are no upper limits on the number of trucks that can be dispatched daily from either warehouse.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the minimum daily raw material requirements (240 pieces of A, 80 kg of B, 120 tons of C) hard constraints that must be met exactly or exceeded, or are they soft targets that can be violated with a penalty?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

They are hard constraints. The production base must receive at least 240 pieces of raw material A, at least 80 kg of raw material B, and at least 120 tons of raw material C daily. These amounts cannot be violated.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

**Confirmed Understanding:**

1.  **Objective:** Minimize total daily freight cost.
    *   Cost per truck from Warehouse A: 200 yuan.
    *   Cost per truck from Warehouse B: 160 yuan.
2.  **Decision Variables:**
    *   $x_A$: Number of trucks dispatched daily from Warehouse A.
    *   $x_B$: Number of trucks dispatched daily from Warehouse B.
3.  **Variable Domain:**
    *   $x_A$ and $x_B$ must be non-negative integers ($x_A, x_B \in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$).
4.  **Constraints (Hard, Minimum Requirements):**
    *   **Raw Material A:** $4x_A + 7x_B \ge 240$ pieces.
    *   **Raw Material B:** $2x_A + 2x_B \ge 80$ kg.
    *   **Raw Material C:** $6x_A + 2x_B \ge 120$ tons.
5.  **Other Assumptions/Clarifications:**
    *   There are no upper bounds on the number of trucks from either warehouse.
    *   The constraints are strict lower bounds (floors); exceeding them is allowed but not penalized directly in the objective function (only the cost of the trucks used is minimized).
    *   No other constraints (e.g., capacity, labor, time windows) apply.
