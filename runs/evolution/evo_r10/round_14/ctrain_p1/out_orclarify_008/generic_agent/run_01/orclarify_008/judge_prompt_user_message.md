# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U4, U6, U2
I need help creating a work assignment plan where exactly 4 out of the 5 workers must be selected, and each task (A, B, C, D) must be assigned to exactly one worker.

Table of hours required by each worker to complete each task:

| Worker | A | B | C | D |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| I      | 9 | 4 | 3 | 7 |
| II     | 4 | 6 | 5 | 6 |
| III    | 5 | 4 | 7 | 5 |
| IV     | 7 | 5 | 2 | 3 |
| V      | 10| 6 | 7 | 4 |

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help creating a work assignment plan.
- U2 (data): Table of hours required by each worker to complete each task:

| Worker | A | B | C | D |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| I      | 9 | 4 | 3 | 7 |
| II     | 4 | 6 | 5 | 6 |
| III    | 5 | 4 | 7 | 5 |
| IV     | 7 | 5 | 2 | 3 |
| V      | 10| 6 | 7 | 4 |
- U3 (objective): Total working hours are to be minimized.
- U4 (constraint): Exactly 4 out of the 5 workers must be selected.
- U5 (constraint): Each selected worker is assigned to exactly one of the four tasks.
- U6 (constraint): Each task (A, B, C, D) must be assigned to exactly one worker.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_minimize_hours_objective
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without the objective, the optimization problem is ill‑posed. The agent cannot formulate a meaningful model, because it does not know what criterion to optimize (minimizing total working hours). Missing this makes the entire modelling attempt impossible or almost certainly wrong.
- Problem unit ID: U3
- Semantic hit rule: The agent’s question must ask about the performance metric to be optimized, explicitly mentioning minimization of total working time or total hours.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the objective we are trying to optimize?
  - Are we minimizing total working hours or something else like cost or makespan?
- Failure modes:
  - Assumption that total working hours is the objective without confirming.
  - Assumption of a different objective such as minimising the maximum completion time or minimising cost.
  - Inventing an objective that does not match the intended problem.

## H2: worker_at_most_one_task_constraint
- Severity: P1
- Severity reason: Without this constraint, an agent may model a worker handling several tasks simultaneously, leading to a materially different assignment structure (e.g., one worker can be assigned to multiple tasks). The problem would still be coherent but would not reflect the intended business rule that each selected worker is responsible for exactly one task.
- Problem unit ID: U5
- Semantic hit rule: The agent’s question must inquire whether a selected worker can be assigned to multiple tasks, or ask for the exact number of tasks each worker may take.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - Is each worker limited to exactly one task, or can a single worker perform more than one task?
  - For the four workers we pick, does each worker get exactly one of the four tasks?
- Failure modes:
  - Assuming a worker can be assigned to more than one task (e.g., one worker does two tasks while another does none).
  - Assuming at most one task per worker but not verifying the 'exactly one' part, leaving task assignments ambiguous.
  - Inventing a flexible capacity per worker that is absent from the original problem.


# Full Transcript

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the goal to minimize the total hours worked across all four assigned tasks?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

Yes, the goal is to minimize the total working hours across all four assigned tasks.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Can a single selected worker be assigned more than one of the four tasks, or must each task go to a different worker?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

Each selected worker is assigned to exactly one of the four tasks, and each task must be assigned to exactly one worker. So, no single worker can be assigned more than one task.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: For the one worker who is not selected, is there any additional cost, penalty, or requirement associated with leaving them unassigned, or is it simply that they do no work?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

It is simply that they do no work. There is no additional cost, penalty, or requirement associated with leaving them unassigned.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- **Decision:** Choose exactly 4 of the 5 workers, and assign each of the 4 tasks (A, B, C, D) to exactly one of the selected workers.
- **One-to-one matching:** Each selected worker gets exactly one task, and each task gets exactly one worker — no worker handles more than one task.
- **Objective:** Minimize the total hours, where the hours for a (worker, task) pair are given by the table:

| Worker | A | B | C | D |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| I      | 9 | 4 | 3 | 7 |
| II     | 4 | 6 | 5 | 6 |
| III    | 5 | 4 | 7 | 5 |
| IV     | 7 | 5 | 2 | 3 |
| V      | 10| 6 | 7 | 4 |

- **Unselected worker:** The one worker not chosen simply does no work — no cost, penalty, or other requirement attached.

This is a small assignment problem: binary variables x[w,t] = 1 if worker w is assigned task t, with constraints that each task is covered exactly once, each worker is assigned at most one task, and exactly 4 workers are used (equivalently, exactly 4 assignments total). The objective is the sum of hours over the chosen (worker, task) pairs.
