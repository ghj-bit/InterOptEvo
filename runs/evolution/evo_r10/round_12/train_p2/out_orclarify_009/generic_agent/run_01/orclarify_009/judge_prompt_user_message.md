# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U8, U9, U10, U11, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6
I need help planning the manufacture of toy trucks, toy airplanes, toy boats, and toy trains, where total wood consumption cannot exceed 890 units and total steel consumption cannot exceed 500 units. Additionally, if trucks are manufactured, then trains are not manufactured, and if boats are manufactured, then airplanes are also manufactured.

Profit per toy: truck $5, airplane $10, boat $8, train $7.

Available wood: 890 units.

Wood required per toy: truck 12 units, airplane 20 units, boat 15 units, train 10 units.

Available steel: 500 units.

Steel required per toy: truck 6 units, airplane 3 units, boat 5 units, train 4 units.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning the manufacture of toy trucks, toy airplanes, toy boats, and toy trains.
- U2 (data): Profit per toy: truck $5, airplane $10, boat $8, train $7.
- U3 (data): Available wood: 890 units.
- U4 (data): Wood required per toy: truck 12 units, airplane 20 units, boat 15 units, train 10 units.
- U5 (data): Available steel: 500 units.
- U6 (data): Steel required per toy: truck 6 units, airplane 3 units, boat 5 units, train 4 units.
- U7 (objective): Maximize total profit.
- U8 (constraint): Total wood consumption cannot exceed 890 units.
- U9 (constraint): Total steel consumption cannot exceed 500 units.
- U10 (constraint): If trucks are manufactured, then trains are not manufactured.
- U11 (constraint): If boats are manufactured, then airplanes are also manufactured.
- U12 (constraint): Number of toy boats manufactured cannot exceed number of toy trains manufactured.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without an objective function, the optimization problem is undefined. A modeling agent cannot proceed to formulate a meaningful model unless the objective is clarified.
- Problem unit ID: U7
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective of the optimization, specifically whether profit should be maximized.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What are we trying to maximize? Should we maximize total profit?
  - Is the goal to maximize profit, or something else like revenue or number of toys produced?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming the objective is to maximize production volume or market share.
  - Assuming the goal is to minimize cost without asking.

## H2: boat_not_exceed_train
- Severity: P2
- Severity reason: The optimization model remains well-defined and solvable without this constraint. The missing rule is a specific business preference that would make the solution more accurate, but its omission does not make the model impossible or fundamentally ill-posed.
- Problem unit ID: U12
- Semantic hit rule: The agent must inquire about a constraint that limits the number of boats relative to the number of trains, specifically asking if boats must be less than or equal to trains.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - Is there any rule linking the number of boats and trains, like boats can't exceed trains?
  - Do we have any production restriction tying the number of boats to the number of trains?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming no relationship between boats and trains and building the model without this constraint.
  - Assuming that boats cannot exceed airplanes instead.

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the production quantities of each toy type required to be whole numbers (integer units), or can they be fractional?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The production quantities must be whole numbers. You cannot manufacture a fraction of a toy.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is there any upper limit on how many of each toy type can be manufactured, or is the only restriction the wood and steel availability?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

There is no specific upper limit on the number of each toy type. The only restrictions are the available wood and steel, plus the rules about which toys can be made together.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: For the rule "if trucks are manufactured, then trains are not manufactured," does this mean that producing even one truck forces zero trains, or is there some other interpretation you intended?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

Producing even one truck forces zero trains.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: For the rule "if boats are manufactured, then airplanes are also manufactured," does producing even one boat require producing at least one airplane?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

Yes, producing even one boat requires producing at least one airplane.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- **Products:** toy trucks, toy airplanes, toy boats, toy trains.
- **Decision variables:** integer (whole-number) production quantities for each of the four toy types, non-negative, with no explicit upper bound beyond resource limits.
- **Objective:** maximize total profit = 5·trucks + 10·airplanes + 8·boats + 7·trains.
- **Resource constraints:**
  - Wood: 12·trucks + 20·airplanes + 15·boats + 10·trains ≤ 890.
  - Steel: 6·trucks + 3·airplanes + 5·boats + 4·trains ≤ 500.
- **Logical rules:**
  - If trucks > 0, then trains = 0 (producing even one truck forces zero trains).
  - If boats > 0, then airplanes ≥ 1 (producing even one boat requires at least one airplane).
- **No other constraints** (no minimum production, no demand limits, no fixed costs).
