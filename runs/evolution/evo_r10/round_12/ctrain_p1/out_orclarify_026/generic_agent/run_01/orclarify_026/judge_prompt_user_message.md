## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U5, U6, U2, U3
I need help planning the staffing for a 24-hour convenience store, and for each time period, the number of salespeople scheduled to work during that period must be at least the required number for that period, while each salesperson works exactly one 8-hour shift, starting at one of the specified start times (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, or 22:00), covering the four consecutive 2-hour periods from the start time.

Required number of salespeople per time period:
2:00-6:00: 10
6:00-10:00: 15
10:00-14:00: 25
14:00-18:00: 20
18:00-22:00: 18
22:00-2:00: 12

Shift start times: 2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00. Shift duration: 8 hours.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning the staffing for a 24-hour convenience store.
- U2 (data): Required number of salespeople per time period:
2:00-6:00: 10
6:00-10:00: 15
10:00-14:00: 25
14:00-18:00: 20
18:00-22:00: 18
22:00-2:00: 12
- U3 (data): Shift start times: 2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00. Shift duration: 8 hours.
- U4 (objective): Minimize the total number of salespeople needed to meet the requirements.
- U5 (constraint): For each time period, the number of salespeople scheduled to work during that period must be at least the required number for that period.
- U6 (constraint): Each salesperson works exactly one 8-hour shift, starting at one of the specified start times (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, or 22:00), covering the four consecutive 2-hour periods from the start time.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_minimization_objective
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without the objective function, the agent cannot determine what constitutes an optimal solution; the problem is ill-posed and modeling cannot proceed meaningfuly.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective or goal of the staffing problem, specifically whether the aim is to minimize the total number of salespeople.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What are we trying to optimize here? Is the goal to minimize the total number of salespeople?
  - Just to confirm, are we minimizing the total headcount of salespeople scheduled overall?
- Failure modes:
  - Silent incorrect assumption: Assuming the objective is to minimize total labor cost rather than total number of salespeople.
  - Silent incorrect assumption: Assuming the objective is to maximize service level or employee satisfaction without clarification.
  - Silent incorrect assumption: Proceeding to build a feasible schedule without any optimization objective.

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: What is the objective of this staffing plan — is it to minimize the total number of salespeople scheduled across all six shifts (equivalently, total staffed hours), or is there a different goal such as minimizing cost with different pay rates per shift?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The objective is to minimize the total number of salespeople scheduled across all six shifts. There are no different pay rates per shift; the goal is simply to find the smallest total number of salespeople needed to meet the coverage requirements in every time block.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the required numbers per time period minimums that must be met or exceeded (i.e., you may schedule more salespeople than required in a period), or must the number scheduled in each period exactly equal the required number?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The required numbers per time period are minimums. You may schedule more salespeople than required in a period, but you cannot schedule fewer.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Should the number of salespeople scheduled for each shift be a whole number (you can't schedule half a person), or is it acceptable to treat them as continuous values?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The number of salespeople scheduled for each shift must be a whole number. You can't schedule half a person.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is there any upper limit on how many salespeople can be scheduled for any single shift, or is the only constraint the minimum coverage requirement per time period?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

There is no upper limit on how many salespeople can be scheduled for any single shift. The only constraint is the minimum coverage requirement per time period.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- **Decision variables:** Six non-negative integer variables, one per shift start time (2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00), representing the number of salespeople starting their 8-hour shift at that time.

- **Shift coverage:** Each 8-hour shift covers four consecutive 2-hour periods. For example, a shift starting at 2:00 covers the periods 2:00–6:00, 6:00–10:00, 10:00–14:00, and 14:00–18:00.

- **Coverage constraints (minimums):** For each of the six 2-hour periods, the sum of salespeople whose shifts cover that period must be at least the required number:
  - 2:00–6:00: ≥ 10
  - 6:00–10:00: ≥ 15
  - 10:00–14:00: ≥ 25
  - 14:00–18:00: ≥ 20
  - 18:00–22:00: ≥ 18
  - 22:00–2:00: ≥ 12

- **Objective:** Minimize the total number of salespeople scheduled across all six shifts (sum of the six decision variables).

- **No upper bounds** on any shift, and all variables are non-negative integers.
