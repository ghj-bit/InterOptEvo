## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U5, U6, U7, U2, U3
I need help planning a daily feed selection for an animal that meets its nutritional requirements, where total protein from the selected feeds must be at least 700 g, total minerals must be at least 30 g, and total vitamins must be at least 100 mg.

Daily nutritional requirements: at least 700 g of protein, 30 g of minerals, and 100 mg of vitamins.

Nutritional content and price per gram of each feed (Table 1-6):
| Feed | Protein (g) | Minerals (g) | Vitamins (mg) | Price (¥/kg) | Feed | Protein (g) | Minerals (g) | Vitamins (mg) | Price (¥/kg) |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1    | 3           | 1            | 0.5           | 0.2          | 4    | 6           | 2            | 2             | 0.3          |
| 2    | 2           | 0.5          | 1             | 0.7          | 5    | 18          | 0.5          | 0.8           | 0.8          |

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning a daily feed selection for an animal that meets its nutritional requirements.
- U2 (data): Daily nutritional requirements: at least 700 g of protein, 30 g of minerals, and 100 mg of vitamins.
- U3 (data): Nutritional content and price per gram of each feed (Table 1-6):
| Feed | Protein (g) | Minerals (g) | Vitamins (mg) | Price (¥/kg) | Feed | Protein (g) | Minerals (g) | Vitamins (mg) | Price (¥/kg) |
|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|------|-------------|--------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1    | 3           | 1            | 0.5           | 0.2          | 4    | 6           | 2            | 2             | 0.3          |
| 2    | 2           | 0.5          | 1             | 0.7          | 5    | 18          | 0.5          | 0.8           | 0.8          |
| 3    | 1           | 0.2          | 0.2           | 0.4          |      |             |              |               |              |
- U4 (objective): Minimize total cost of selecting the feed.
- U5 (constraint): Total protein from the selected feeds must be at least 700 g.
- U6 (constraint): Total minerals from the selected feeds must be at least 30 g.
- U7 (constraint): Total vitamins from the selected feeds must be at least 100 mg.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective_function
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without knowing the objective, the modeling agent cannot define the optimization direction. The problem does not specify whether to minimize cost, maximize nutritional content, or something else. A responsible agent must clarify this before formulating the model.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the optimization objective, such as what we are trying to minimize or maximize, or specifically mention whether cost is being minimized.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the goal of the feeding plan? Are we minimizing cost or something else?
  - Should we minimize the total cost of the selected feeds?
- Failure modes:
  - Silent incorrect assumption that the objective is to minimize total cost.
  - Silent incorrect assumption that the objective is to minimize total feed weight.

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is there a maximum daily amount (in grams) that can be used of each feed, or are the feed amounts only limited by the nutritional minimums and non-negativity?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The feed amounts are only limited by the nutritional minimums and non-negativity. There is no maximum daily amount for each feed.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the objective to minimize the total daily cost of the selected feeds?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

Yes, the objective is to minimize the total daily cost of the selected feeds.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: The table lists nutritional content per feed without specifying the unit basis — is the protein, minerals, and vitamins content shown for each feed the amount contained in 1 gram of that feed?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

Yes, the protein, minerals, and vitamins content shown for each feed is the amount contained in 1 gram of that feed.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: The prices are given in ¥/kg while the nutritional content is per gram — should I convert the prices to ¥/gram (i.e., divide each price by 1000) when computing the total daily cost in grams?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

Yes, convert the prices to ¥/gram by dividing each price by 1000 when computing the total daily cost in grams.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- **Problem type:** Daily feed-mixing (diet) problem — choose how many grams of each of 5 feeds to use.
- **Decision variables:** x_i = grams of feed i used per day, for i = 1..5, each x_i ≥ 0. No upper bound on any feed.
- **Objective:** Minimize total daily cost = Σ (price_i/1000)·x_i, where prices are converted from ¥/kg to ¥/g by dividing by 1000:
  - Feed 1: 0.2/1000 = 0.0002 ¥/g
  - Feed 2: 0.7/1000 = 0.0007 ¥/g
  - Feed 3: 0.4/1000 = 0.0004 ¥/g
  - Feed 4: 0.3/1000 = 0.0003 ¥/g
  - Feed 5: 0.8/1000 = 0.0008 ¥/g
- **Nutritional content per gram of feed:**
  - Feed 1: 3 g protein, 1 g minerals, 0.5 mg vitamins
  - Feed 2: 2 g protein, 0.5 g minerals, 1 mg vitamins
  - Feed 3: 1 g protein, 0.2 g minerals, 0.2 mg vitamins
  - Feed 4: 6 g protein, 2 g minerals, 2 mg vitamins
  - Feed 5: 18 g protein, 0.5 g minerals, 0.8 mg vitamins
- **Constraints (minimums, "at least"):**
  - Protein: 3x1 + 2x2 + 1x3 + 6x4 + 18x5 ≥ 700 g
  - Minerals: 1x1 + 0.5x2 + 0.2x3 + 2x4 + 0.5x5 ≥ 30 g
  - Vitamins: 0.5x1 + 1x2 + 0.2x3 + 2x4 + 0.8x5 ≥ 100 mg
- **No other constraints** (no per-feed caps, no fixed amounts, no exclusions).

This is a standard linear program: minimize a linear cost subject to three linear nutrient lower-bound constraints and non-negativity.
