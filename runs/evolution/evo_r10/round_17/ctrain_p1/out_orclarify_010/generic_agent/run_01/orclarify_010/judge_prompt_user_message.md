## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning the opening of several chain stores in a new residential area.
- U2 (data): | Area Code | Residential Areas within 800 m Radius |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| A         | A, C, E, G, H, I                      |
| B         | B, H, I                               |

| K         | F, J, K, L                            |
| L         | J, K, L                               |
- U3 (objective): Minimize the number of chain stores built.
- U4 (constraint): The distance from any residential area to at least one chain store must not exceed 800 meters.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: max_distance_800m
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without this constraint, the problem reduces to minimizing an unbounded number of stores with no service coverage requirement, making the model ill-posed and the provided distance table irrelevant.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The Agent's question must explicitly ask about the coverage radius or maximum allowed distance for a residential area to be considered served by a chain store.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the maximum allowed distance between a residential area and the nearest chain store?
  - Do we need to ensure every residential area is within 800 meters of at least one store?
- Failure modes:
  - Assuming all residential areas are served regardless of distance
  - Assuming the data table is just for reference and not a hard constraint

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the goal to ensure that every residential area (A through L) is within 800 m of at least one built chain store, with no other requirements?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

Yes, that is the goal. Every residential area (A through L) must be within 800 meters of at least one built chain store. There are no other requirements.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Can a chain store be built in any of the 12 areas (A through L), or are some areas excluded from being store locations?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

A chain store can be built in any of the 12 areas (A through L). No areas are excluded from being store locations.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the coverage relationship symmetric — that is, if area X is listed in area Y's row, does a store in X also cover area Y, or does a store in Y only cover the areas listed in Y's row?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

A store in area Y covers the areas listed in Y's row. The coverage is not necessarily symmetric; a store in X covers the areas listed in X's row.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is there any limit on the total number of stores that can be built, or is the only objective to minimize the count with no upper bound?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

There is no limit on the total number of stores that can be built. The only objective is to minimize the count, with no upper bound.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- **Decision variables:** A binary variable for each of the 12 areas (A–L), indicating whether a chain store is built there.
- **Objective:** Minimize the total number of stores built (sum of all binary variables).
- **Constraints:** For each residential area (A–L), at least one store must be built in an area whose coverage row includes that residential area. Coverage is directional: a store in area Y covers exactly the areas listed in Y's row.
- **No other constraints:** No upper bound on store count, no cost differences between areas, no exclusions, no capacity or demand requirements.

This is a classic **set covering problem**: choose the minimum number of sets (store locations) such that every element (residential area) is covered by at least one chosen set.
