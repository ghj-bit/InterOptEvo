# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U4, U6, U8, U2, U3
I need help deciding how to allocate acres to corn, wheat, soybeans, and sorghum to maximize the total profit, given that the total land area used for all crops cannot exceed 100 acres and the land area used for planting soybeans must be at least half the land area used for planting sorghum.

Profit per acre for planting crops: corn $1500, wheat $1200, soybeans $1800, sorghum $1600.

Tom and Jerry’s farm has a total area of 100 acres.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help deciding how to allocate acres to corn, wheat, soybeans, and sorghum.
- U2 (data): Profit per acre for planting crops: corn $1500, wheat $1200, soybeans $1800, sorghum $1600.
- U3 (data): Tom and Jerry’s farm has a total area of 100 acres.
- U4 (constraint): The total land area used for all crops cannot exceed 100 acres.
- U5 (constraint): The land area used for planting corn must be at least twice the land area used for planting wheat.
- U6 (constraint): The land area used for planting soybeans must be at least half the land area used for planting sorghum.
- U7 (constraint): The land area used for planting wheat must be three times the land area used for planting sorghum.
- U8 (objective): Maximize the total profit.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: corn_minimum_twice_wheat
- Severity: P1
- Severity reason: Without this constraint, the model would not enforce a key business rule linking corn and wheat acreages, leading to a materially different allocation and profit.
- Problem unit ID: U5
- Semantic hit rule: The agent asks whether there is a minimum ratio or multiplier linking corn and wheat acreage, or specifically inquires about a constraint like corn >= 2 * wheat.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - Is there a requirement that the corn acreage be at least double the wheat acreage?
  - Do you have any rule relating corn and wheat, for instance that corn must be at least twice wheat?
- Failure modes:
  - Assuming no relationship between corn and wheat acreages
  - Assuming corn and wheat can be planted independently without any relative size restriction

## H2: wheat_three_times_sorghum
- Severity: P1
- Severity reason: Omitting this fixed ratio between wheat and sorghum changes the feasible region and profit outcome, making the model inconsistent with the intended farm plan.
- Problem unit ID: U7
- Semantic hit rule: The agent asks if wheat and sorghum acreages are linked by a fixed ratio, or specifically inquires about a constraint like wheat = 3 * sorghum.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - Is there a prescribed relationship between wheat and sorghum acres, for example that wheat should be three times sorghum?
  - Do you require the wheat area to be exactly three times the sorghum area?
- Failure modes:
  - Assuming wheat and sorghum acreages are independent
  - Assuming soybean-sorghum ratio is the only relational constraint

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the 100-acre limit a hard cap on the total acres planted (so you may plant fewer than 100 acres in total), or must all 100 acres be planted with one of the four crops?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

It is a hard cap. You may plant fewer than 100 acres in total.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any minimum or maximum acre requirements for any individual crop (corn, wheat, soybeans, or sorghum), or can any crop be planted on zero acres?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

There are no minimum or maximum acre requirements for any individual crop. Any crop can be planted on zero acres.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Can the acreage allocated to each crop be any fractional value (e.g., 12.5 acres), or must each crop be planted on a whole number of acres?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The acreage allocated to each crop can be any fractional value.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the soybean-sorghum rule a one-way requirement (soybean acres must be at least half of sorghum acres, with no limit on how much sorghum can exceed soybeans), or is it a two-way relationship (sorghum acres must also be at least half of soybean acres)?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

It is a one-way requirement. Soybean acres must be at least half of sorghum acres. There is no limit on how much sorghum can exceed soybeans.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- **Decision variables:** Acres allocated to each of the four crops — corn (C), wheat (W), soybeans (S), sorghum (G). All are continuous (fractional values allowed) and non-negative; any crop may be planted on zero acres.
- **Objective:** Maximize total profit = 1500·C + 1200·W + 1800·S + 1600·G.
- **Constraints:**
  1. Total land: C + W + S + G ≤ 100 (hard cap; planting fewer than 100 acres is allowed).
  2. Soybean–sorghum rule (one-way): S ≥ 0.5·G (soybean acres at least half of sorghum acres; no reverse limit).
  3. Non-negativity: C, W, S, G ≥ 0.
- **No other constraints:** no per-crop minimums or maximums, no other coupling between crops.

Note: since soybeans have the highest profit per acre ($1800) and the only coupling constraint (S ≥ 0.5·G) is satisfied with room to spare when sorghum is small, the optimum will push acreage toward the highest-profit crops subject to the 100-acre cap.
