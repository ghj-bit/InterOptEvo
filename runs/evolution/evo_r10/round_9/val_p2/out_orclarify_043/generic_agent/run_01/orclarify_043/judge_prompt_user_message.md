# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U5, U6, U7, U2, U3
I need help planning how many trucks to dispatch daily from two warehouses to a production base, with the requirement that at least 240 pieces of raw material A, 80 kg of raw material B, and 120 tons of raw material C must be brought in daily.

Minimum daily raw material requirements: at least 240 pieces of raw material A, at least 80 kg of raw material B, at least 120 tons of raw material C.

Each truck from warehouse A can transport back to the production base 4 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 6 tons of raw material C, with a freight cost of 200 yuan per truck; each truck from warehouse B can transport back to the production base 7 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 2 tons of raw material C per day, with a freight cost of 160 yuan per truck.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help planning how many trucks to dispatch daily from two warehouses to a production base.
- U2 (data): Minimum daily raw material requirements: at least 240 pieces of raw material A, at least 80 kg of raw material B, at least 120 tons of raw material C.
- U3 (data): Each truck from warehouse A can transport back to the production base 4 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 6 tons of raw material C, with a freight cost of 200 yuan per truck; each truck from warehouse B can transport back to the production base 7 pieces of raw material A, 2 kg of raw material B, 2 tons of raw material C per day, with a freight cost of 160 yuan per truck.
- U4 (objective): Minimize total freight cost.
- U5 (constraint): At least 240 pieces of raw material A must be brought in daily.
- U6 (constraint): At least 80 kg of raw material B must be brought in daily.
- U7 (constraint): At least 120 tons of raw material C must be brought in daily.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective_function
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without an objective, the optimization problem is ill-posed; the modeling agent cannot formulate a meaningful model without knowing what to minimize or maximize.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask about the objective or what to optimize, specifically mentioning minimizing or maximizing something, or inquiring about the goal.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the objective we are trying to achieve? Should we minimize total cost?
  - Are we aiming to minimize the total freight cost?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming the objective is to minimize total freight cost without confirming with the user.
  - Assuming the objective is to maximize some other metric like profit or minimize number of trucks.

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Should the number of trucks dispatched from each warehouse be a whole number (integer), or is it acceptable to treat them as continuous values in the plan?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The number of trucks must be a whole number (integer). You cannot dispatch a fraction of a truck.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Is the goal to minimize the total daily freight cost, or is there another objective (such as maximizing total material delivered or minimizing the number of trucks used)?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The goal is to minimize the total daily freight cost.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any upper limits on how many trucks can be dispatched from warehouse A or warehouse B per day, or can we dispatch as many trucks as needed from each warehouse?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

There are no upper limits on the number of trucks that can be dispatched from warehouse A or warehouse B per day.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: If the dispatched trucks deliver more than the minimum required amounts of raw materials A, B, or C, is that excess acceptable (i.e., the requirements are lower bounds only), or must the deliveries match the requirements exactly?

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

The requirements are lower bounds only. Delivering more than the minimum required amounts of raw materials A, B, or C is acceptable.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

Confirmed understanding:

- **Decision variables:** Number of trucks dispatched daily from warehouse A (x) and from warehouse B (y). Both must be non-negative integers (whole numbers, no fractions).
- **Objective:** Minimize total daily freight cost = 200x + 160y (yuan).
- **Constraints (lower bounds on daily deliveries):**
  - Raw material A: 4x + 7y ≥ 240 pieces
  - Raw material B: 2x + 2y ≥ 80 kg
  - Raw material C: 6x + 2y ≥ 120 tons
- **No upper limits** on the number of trucks from either warehouse.
- **Excess deliveries** of any raw material beyond the minimums are acceptable (requirements are lower bounds only).
