# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U7, U8, U9, U10, U12, U2, U3, U4, U5, U6
I need help deciding whether to hire some of the five candidates for our R&D team, where the total salary paid to hired candidates cannot exceed the budget, the number of hired candidates cannot exceed the maximum number of new hires, the total skill level of hired candidates must be at least 8, and the total project management experience of hired candidates must be at least 8 years, with the objective to minimize the total salary paid to hired candidates.

Candidate data:
| Candidate | Salary | Skill Level | Project Management Experience (years) |
|-----------|--------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| F         | 12000  | 2           | 1                                      |

| H         | 18000  | 4           | 2                                      |
| I         | 5000   | 1           | 5                                      |

Budget: $40,000

Maximum number of new hires: 4

Minimum required total skill level: 8

Minimum required total project management experience (years): 8

- U3 (data): Budget: $40,000
- U4 (data): Maximum number of new hires: 4
- U5 (data): Minimum required total skill level: 8
- U6 (data): Minimum required total project management experience (years): 8
- U7 (constraint): Total salary paid to hired candidates cannot exceed the budget.
- U8 (constraint): The number of hired candidates cannot exceed the maximum number of new hires.
- U9 (constraint): The total skill level of hired candidates must be at least 8.
- U10 (constraint): The total project management experience of hired candidates must be at least 8 years.
- U11 (constraint): At most one of candidates G and J can be hired.
- U12 (objective): Minimize the total salary paid to hired candidates.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: at_most_one_of_G_and_J
- Severity: P2
- Severity reason: Without this constraint, the problem remains a coherent optimization problem with budget, skill, experience, and headcount limits. Omitting it simply expands the feasible set but does not make modeling impossible or materially incorrect; it is a specific business preference.
- Problem unit ID: U11
- Semantic hit rule: The Agent's question must explicitly mention the limitation on hiring both G and J, or ask whether only one of them can be hired.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - Is there any restriction on hiring both G and J, or can we hire them both?
  - Should we include a condition that we can't hire both G and J together because of their similar backgrounds?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming both G and J can be hired without any mutual exclusion constraint.
  - Assuming there is no restriction on hiring candidates with similar backgrounds.

READY_TO_MODEL

Formulatable confidence: 1.000

Confidence rationale: The request provides all necessary data, constraints, and objective function parameters. The decision variables (binary hire/no-hire), objective (minimize salary), and constraints (budget, max hires, min skill, min experience) are explicitly defined with no ambiguity.

Summary: Binary integer programming problem to select a subset of 5 candidates to minimize total salary, subject to a budget of $40,000, a maximum of 4 hires, a minimum total skill level of 8, and a minimum total project management experience of 8 years.
