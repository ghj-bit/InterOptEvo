# Case facts for Judge

## Initial brief shown to Generic Agent
Visible unit IDs: U1, U6, U7, U2, U3, U4, U5
I need help deciding whether to hire contract nurses and how many to schedule, given that during each time period, the total number of nurses on duty must be at least the required number for that period, and each nurse assigned to a shift works continuously for 8 hours, covering the appropriate time intervals.

Required number of nurses per time period:
2:00-6:00: 10
6:00-10:00: 15
10:00-14:00: 25
14:00-18:00: 20
18:00-22:00: 18
22:00-2:00: 12

Shift start times: 2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00. Each shift lasts 8 continuous hours.

Regular nurse pay: 10 yuan/hour. Contract nurse pay: 15 yuan/hour.

Contract nurses can be hired and work the same shift structure (8-hour shifts at the same start times) as regular nurses.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help deciding whether to hire contract nurses and how many to schedule.
- U2 (data): Required number of nurses per time period:
2:00-6:00: 10
6:00-10:00: 15
10:00-14:00: 25
14:00-18:00: 20
18:00-22:00: 18
22:00-2:00: 12
- U3 (data): Shift start times: 2:00, 6:00, 10:00, 14:00, 18:00, 22:00. Each shift lasts 8 continuous hours.
- U4 (data): Regular nurse pay: 10 yuan/hour. Contract nurse pay: 15 yuan/hour.
- U5 (data): Contract nurses can be hired and work the same shift structure (8-hour shifts at the same start times) as regular nurses.
- U6 (constraint): During each time period, the total number of nurses on duty must be at least the required number for that period.
- U7 (constraint): Each nurse assigned to a shift works continuously for 8 hours, covering the appropriate time intervals.
- U8 (objective): Minimize total nurse payroll cost.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: minimize_total_payroll_cost
- Severity: P1
- Severity reason: Without explicitly knowing the objective is to minimize total nurse payroll cost, an agent might assume a different goal (e.g., minimize number of nurses or minimize number of contract nurses). Clarifying this ensures the model correctly accounts for the cost differential between regular and contract nurses.
- Problem unit ID: U8
- Semantic hit rule: The Agent's question must explicitly ask about the optimization objective, specifically whether the goal is to minimize total payroll cost, or what quantity should be minimized.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the objective of the optimization? Should I minimize total cost?
  - Are we trying to minimize the total nurse payroll cost, or is there another metric?
- Failure modes:
  - Silent incorrect assumption: assuming the objective is to minimize the total number of nurses rather than cost.
  - Silent incorrect assumption: assuming the objective is to minimize the number of contract nurses hired.
  - Proceeding to model without clarifying the objective, resulting in a model that does not optimize total payroll cost.


# Atomic Question Map

Q1 (turn 1): How many regular nurses are available to schedule in each shift or overall, if any limit exists?
Q2 (turn 2): What is the primary objective you want the schedule to optimize, for example minimizing total labor cost or minimizing the number of contract nurses hired?
Q3 (turn 3): Are regular nurses required to be scheduled for their shifts whenever possible, or can the hospital choose to hire contract nurses instead even if regular nurses are available?

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: How many regular nurses are available to schedule in each shift or overall, if any limit exists?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

There is no limit stated in the information I provided on the number of regular nurses available to schedule.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: What is the primary objective you want the schedule to optimize, for example minimizing total labor cost or minimizing the number of contract nurses hired?

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The primary objective is to minimize total nurse payroll cost.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are regular nurses required to be scheduled for their shifts whenever possible, or can the hospital choose to hire contract nurses instead even if regular nurses are available?

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The hospital can choose to hire contract nurses instead of using regular nurses if that helps meet the objective. There is no requirement I provided that regular nurses must be scheduled whenever possible.
