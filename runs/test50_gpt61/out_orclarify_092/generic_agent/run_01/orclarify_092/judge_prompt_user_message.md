I need help organizing transportation for a school trip, subject to the constraints that the total seating capacity of the selected buses and minibuses must be at least 400 students, at most 10 buses and 8 minibuses can be used, and the total number of vehicles (buses and minibuses) cannot exceed 9.

Number of students: 400.

Available vehicles: 10 buses (50 seats each), 8 minibuses (40 seats each).

Number of available drivers: 9.

Rental cost per bus: £800; rental cost per minibus: £600.

## Problem units
- U1 (context): I need help organizing transportation for a school trip.
- U2 (data): Number of students: 400.
- U3 (data): Available vehicles: 10 buses (50 seats each), 8 minibuses (40 seats each).
- U4 (data): Number of available drivers: 9.
- U5 (data): Rental cost per bus: £800; rental cost per minibus: £600.
- U6 (objective): Minimize the total rental cost.
- U7 (constraint): The total seating capacity of the selected buses and minibuses must be at least 400 students.
- U8 (constraint): At most 10 buses can be used.
- U9 (constraint): At most 8 minibuses can be used.
- U10 (constraint): The total number of vehicles (buses and minibuses) used cannot exceed 9.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective_function
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: The problem statement only says 'achieve the lowest cost' but does not explicitly define the objective function. Without knowing it is to minimize total rental cost, the modeling agent cannot build a valid optimization model. This is a fatal gap that makes the model impossible to formulate without clarification.
- Problem unit ID: U6
- Semantic hit rule: The Agent's question must directly ask about the objective function, explicitly mentioning minimization of cost or total rental expenditure.
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What exactly is the objective we're trying to optimize? Is it minimizing the total rental cost?
  - Should the model minimize the total amount of money spent on bus and minibus rentals?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming the goal is to minimize the number of vehicles used, not the rental cost.
  - Silently assuming the lowest cost refers to per-student cost rather than total rental cost.

QUESTION: Should I find the lowest-cost feasible combination of buses and minibuses?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

Yes.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL

The objective is to find the lowest-cost combination of available buses and minibuses that:

- Seats at least 400 students
- Uses no more than 10 buses and 8 minibuses
- Uses no more than 9 total vehicles
- Uses no more than 9 drivers
- Minimizes rental cost

The lowest-cost feasible combination is **4 buses and 5 minibuses**:

- Capacity: `(4 × 50) + (5 × 40) = 400 seats`
- Vehicles: `4 + 5 = 9`
- Drivers required: `9`
- Cost: `(4 × £800) + (5 × £600) = £6,200`

**Recommendation: rent 4 buses and 5 minibuses at a total cost of £6,200.**
