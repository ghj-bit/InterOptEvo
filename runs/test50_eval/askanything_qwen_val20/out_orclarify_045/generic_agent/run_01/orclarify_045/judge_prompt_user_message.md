I need help creating a production plan for a factory producing three types of products, where total technical preparation time used must not exceed 100 hours, total labor time used must not exceed 700 hours, and total materials used must not exceed 400 kg.

Each unit of product A requires 1 hour for technical preparation, 10 hours of direct labor, and 3 kg of materials. Each unit of product B requires 2 hours for technical preparation, 4 hours of labor, and 2 kg of materials. Each unit of product C requires 1 hour for technical preparation, 5 hours of labor, and 1 kg of materials. The available technical preparation time is 100 hours, labor time is 700 hours, and materials are 400 kg.

- U1 (context): I need help creating a production plan for a factory producing three types of products.
- U2 (data): Each unit of product A requires 1 hour for technical preparation, 10 hours of direct labor, and 3 kg of materials. Each unit of product B requires 2 hours for technical preparation, 4 hours of labor, and 2 kg of materials. Each unit of product C requires 1 hour for technical preparation, 5 hours of labor, and 1 kg of materials. The available technical preparation time is 100 hours, labor time is 700 hours, and materials are 400 kg.

- U4 (objective): Maximize profit.
- U5 (constraint): Total technical preparation time used must not exceed 100 hours.
- U6 (constraint): Total labor time used must not exceed 700 hours.
- U7 (constraint): Total materials used must not exceed 400 kg.

## Hidden slot scoring rules
## H1: missing_objective
- Severity: P0
- Severity reason: Without knowing the objective, the modeling agent cannot formulate any optimization model. Any assumed objective (e.g., minimize cost) would be completely arbitrary and almost certainly wrong. This is a must-clarify fatal gap.
- Problem unit ID: U4
- Semantic hit rule: The agent's question must explicitly ask what the objective of the optimization is, or directly inquire whether to maximize profit (as opposed to any other default objective).
- Reference acceptable questions:
  - What is the objective of the production plan? Should we aim to maximize profit?
  - Are we trying to maximize total profit, or is there another target like minimizing costs or maximizing revenue?
- Failure modes:
  - Silently assuming the objective is to minimize total cost
  - Assuming the objective is to maximize total revenue
  - Assuming a multi-objective or unspecified goal without clarification

## Turn 1 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: What is the primary objective of this production plan, such as maximizing total profit, meeting a specific demand target, or minimizing total cost?

## Turn 1 - User Simulator

The primary objective is to maximize total profit.

## Turn 2 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the sales volume ranges in the table (e.g., "0 ~ 40") interpreted as continuous intervals where any quantity within the range is allowed, or are they discrete blocks where you must produce exactly the upper limit of one block before moving to the next

## Turn 2 - User Simulator

The sales volume ranges are continuous intervals where any quantity within the range is allowed.

## Turn 3 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are the production quantities for products A, B, and C required to be whole numbers

## Turn 3 - User Simulator

The production quantities for products A, B, and C are required to be whole numbers.

## Turn 4 - Generic Agent

QUESTION: Are there any minimum production requirements for each product

## Turn 4 - User Simulator

There are no minimum production requirements for each product.

## Turn 5 - Generic Agent

READY_TO_MODEL
I have confirmed the following details for the production plan:
1.  **Objective:** Maximize total profit.
2.  **Products:** Three types (A, B, C).
3.  **Constraints:**
    *   Technical preparation time: $\le 100$ hours.
    *   Labor time: $\le 700$ hours.
    *   Materials: $\le 400$ kg.
4.  **Resource Consumption per Unit:**
    *   Product A: 1 hr prep, 10 hrs labor, 3 kg materials.
    *   Product B: 2 hrs prep, 4 hrs labor, 2 kg materials.
    *   Product C: 1 hr prep, 5 hrs labor, 1 kg materials.
5.  **Profit Structure:** Piecewise linear based on production quantity, with continuous intervals:
    *   **Product A:**
        *   0–40 units: 10 yuan/unit
        *   40–100 units: 9 yuan/unit
        *   100–150 units: 8 yuan/unit
        *   >150 units: 7 yuan/unit
    *   **Product B:**
        *   0–50 units: 6 yuan/unit
        *   50–100 units: 4 yuan/unit
        *   >100 units: 3 yuan/unit
    *   **Product C:**
        *   0–100 units: 5 yuan/unit
        *   >100 units: 4 yuan/unit
6.  **Variable Type:** Production quantities must be non-negative integers.
